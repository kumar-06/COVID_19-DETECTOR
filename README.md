# COVID_19-DETECTOR
A CNN based model to predict weather a person is infected with covid 19 or not using the xray images of lungs.
Tech stacks used to create this mode are-
1.PYTHON.
2.PANDAS
3.NUMPY
4.MATPLOTLIB
5.KERAS
6.OS
7.SHUTIL
8.TENSORFLOW
This model is primarily coded on GOOGLE COLAB and for data cleaning jupyter notebook was used.
The data requred for this model were taken from -
1.https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset
2.https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia
The data collected from these sources were merged inorder to create a robust dataset for COVID-19 detection using os module in jupyter notebook.

After the training this model for 10 epochs an overall 96% accuracy was acheived for training data and an accuracy of 98% was achieved for validation
data.
